- change package version to git id for non-released branches
- quiet the build process, like recent guile
- change traversal queue into a LIFO
- traversal objects should _weakly reference_ spectra
- throw exceptions when bmrb files fail to read
- asynchronous traversal: can 'ready' signal just be sent from another thread,
  rather than using the 'ready queue' mechanism?
