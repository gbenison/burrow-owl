========== 'connect' bug =============
9jan07

Symptom:       "ERROR: No variable named connect in #<module (guile) b7f06e40>"
Workaround:    In your guile script, load the module 'burrow hacks' first, i.e.
               (use-modules (burrow hacks)
                            (guile gnome))
Cause:         Some versions of guile-gnome (2.15.95 -- ?) expect the root guile
               module to contain a binding for 'connect', but some guiles do not.
