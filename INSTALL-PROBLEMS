This is a list of known problems that can come up during installation of burrow-owl.


========== 'connect' bug =============
9jan08

Symptom:       "ERROR: No variable named connect in #<module (guile) b7f06e40>"
Workaround:    In your guile script, load the module 'burrow hacks' first, i.e.
               (use-modules (burrow hacks)
                            (guile gnome))
Cause:         Some versions of guile-gnome (2.15.95 -- ?) expect the root guile
               module to contain a binding for 'connect', but some guiles do
               not.

========== srfi-35 bug =============
11jan08

Symptom:     ERROR: Wrong type argument in position 1 (expecting class): #<condition-type &error b7ed0dc0>
Cause:       g-wrap provides its own version of file srfi-35.scm, which
	     is incompatible with the srfi-35.scm distributed with
	     guile-1.8.3.
Workaround:  Verify that you can reproduce the error with
	     "guile -c '(use-modules (g-wrap))'"
             then apply patches/srfi-35.patch:
             cd somewhere/g-wrap-1.9.x
             patch -p0 -l < srfi-35.patch
             make && make install

========== GdkColor bug =============
28jul08

Symptom:     gdk-color.test fails; random crashes due to (set foo 'color ...)
Cause:       conflict between guile-gnome <= 2.16.1, gtk+ >= 2.10
Workaround:  Apply patches/gdk-color.patch to guile-gnome-platform sources:
             cd guile-gnome-platform-2.16.1/gtk
             patch -p0 -l < gdk-color.patch
             make && make install

========== LIBFFI_CFLAGS_INSTALLED bug =============
28jul08

Symptom:     guile-gnome fails to build with errors about
             @LIBFFI_CFLAGS_INSTALLED@
Workaround:  Apply patches/libffi-cflags.patch in g-wrap source dir
             cd g-wrap-1.9.11
             patch -p0 -l < libffi-cflags.patch
             make && make install
